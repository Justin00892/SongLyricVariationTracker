On a cold winter morning
In the time before the light
In flames of death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in Hell's domain
We watch them as they go
Through the fire and pain and once again we know
So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness
Our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown
Far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the mid morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars
In your darkest dreams see to believe
Our destiny is time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight
And on the wings of a dream
So far beyond reality
All alone in desperation
Now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find
Lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on
So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on
Woah, woah, whoah
Woah, woah, whoah
Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard, now can we understand
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man
So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

Smashing through the boundaries
Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the evil one on towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain
Still we're searching endlessly
Crashing over seven seas
Torturing the winter skies riding over plains of ice
Shadows in the fields of the slain!
Crashing steel and raging fury smash the quest destroy their army
Crush the legions of the twilight, templars of steel will burn
Cry far away as we reach for the day
Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain
Reach for the world as the sky begins to fall
Rising through the darkened ashes praying that I'll see you all
Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside the chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight
Watch you die I watch you die inside while fear controls your life
And reject this animosity that killed so many minds
You feel the power deep within the fear you hold inside
Just to find the reason for the treason now you will be mine
Screams of pain in death descending rise again from hell defending
Burn their hearts within the fire, warriors of light will be slain
Rise through the pain like the sun will rise again
Day after day but the memories never change
Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls
Blinded by the vision and the innocence of our souls
Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside the chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight
Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun
Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside the chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight
